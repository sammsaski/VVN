# Robustness Verification of Video Classification Neural Networks
A Benchmark for the verification of video classification networks. 

# Using MATLAB
Navigate to `~/MATLAB/R2023a/bin/` and run `./matlab` to start up MATLAB 2023a. 

Don't forget to install the NNV toolbox and the npy-matlab toolbox before running.

# requirements.txt
Numpy could not be upgraded from 1.26.4 to 2.0.0 because of some incompatability with onnxruntime.

# Reproducing/Running VVN Experiments
1. MATLAB 2024a with NNV installed and both of NNV and npy-matlab added to the path.
2. conda environment with Python=3.11. Install requirements from requirements.txt. Make sure to install the vvn Python package.
