# Robustness Verification of Video Classification Neural Networks
A Benchmark for the verification of video classification networks. 

# Using MATLAB
Navigate to `~/MATLAB/R2023a/bin/` and run `./matlab` to start up MATLAB 2023a. 

Don't forget to install the NNV toolbox and the npy-matlab toolbox before running.
